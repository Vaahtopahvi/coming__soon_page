# Coming soon page
This is a simple landing page created with React and help of [FlipClockCountdown](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@leenguyen/react-flip-clock-countdown) package from npmjs, which displays the actual clock.

It also has a simple cool looking video background with an overlay to make it a bit darker and to make the text stand out.
